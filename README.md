# Colonial High School Volunteering Program

## About
This started as a personal project that was left to me by a fellow colleague of mine whom I met through the STEM Ambassadors leadership program at the University of Central Florida. He got in contact with the volunteer coordinator of Colonial High School (CHS) in Orlando, Florida, to provide support to the AP Computer Science Principles (CSP) instructor by dropping by once a week and demonstrating programming concepts and principles within the Python programming language

It was left to me on August 2018. Beginning of the Summer of 2019, I began to develop a volunteering framework to propose as an official program between CHS and the Zeta Chi Chapter of the Eta Kappa Nu (HKN) Honors Society. Beginning of the 2019 - 2020 school year, I recruited two students to aid me in the development of this framework. Programming assignments were developed, alongside tester programs whenever applicable so that the students can test their own implementations against a set of test cases. Weekly quizzes were developed to test their knowledge of what they have learned, and in preparation for their AP CSP exam.

### AP Computer Science Principals Exam

Students who take the AP Computer Science Principals Exam is given a score between 0 and 5, with 5 being the highest possible score, a 3 being a passing score. Depending on how well the student performs on the exam, a university may offer credit towards a course they offer. The exam is broken down, and is graded as follows:

#### Section I: Performance Tasks

Constitutes 40% of a student's overall score.

- **Performance Task 1: Create - Applications from Ideas**. Students will develop a computer program of their choice.

- **Performance Task 2: Explore - Impact of Computing Innovations**. Students will identify a computing innovation, explore its impact, and create a related digital artifact.

#### Section II: End-of-Course Exam

Constitutes 60% of a student's overall score. Approximately 74 multiple-choice questions over the course of 2 hours.

## Directory Structure

Currently, there are two main directories of concern: **2018 - 2019** and **2019 - 2020**. Each of those directories will have their own README files specific to that directory.
