# 2018-2019 Resources

## About

This directory contains all, if not most, of the programming assignments that were developed by me for the 2018-2019 academic year at Colonial High School in Florida, Orlando, for their AP Computer Science Principles course. Some programs were written in Python 2 before a decision was made to transition over to Python 3. As a notice, Python 2 reached its end-of-support lifetime on January 1st, 2020.

## Assignments

Assignments were developed in such a way to provide practice opportunities for students at further enhancing their understanding of programming concepts:

- **Big Pizza Pie**: Simple program I/O and mathematical operators
- **Grade Converter**: Conditional statements and logic operators
- **Loops**: for and while loops
- **King Dice Roller**: Mixture of what's already been previously covered (i.e. all of the above)
- **Bugs in the System**: Aimed at providing an opportunity for students to develop their debugging skills
- **Fresh Market Markup**: Data structures of dictionaries and lists
- **Functional Overload**: Function definition and implementation
- **Bits & Pieces**: Split into two parts, as follows

    **Part One**: Numerical systems, and working with binary/decimal conversions in programming.
    
    **Part Two**: Mini-project on the simulation of an embedded programming environment
- **Of Dice & Dragons**: Split into two parts. Serves as a proper introduction into object-oriented programming (OOP)
