# 2019-2020 Resources

## About

These assignments are of a much higher difficulty in comparison to the assignments developed for the previous academic year of 2018-2019. This is due to more time being taken before an assignment is pushed out that covers multiple concepts at once. Assignments took a more functional approach in comparison to the previous year, due to tester programs that were provided to allow students an opportunity to see whether their implementation was done correctly or not.

## Assignments

- **IDLE Intro**: Serves as an introduction to the IDLE environment, where students are expected to be writing the majority of their code
- **Functional Overload**: Function definitions, data types, math operators, conditional statements and logic operators
- **Word Soup**: Iterative statements, lists & dictionaries
- **Binomial Coefficients**: Recursion
- **Ouroboros**: Linked lists
- **The Barnyard**: Introduction to object-oriented programming (OOP)

## Contributors & Volunteers

Here is a list of the student volunteers that aided in the development of some of the programming assignments listed above:

- Gustavo Diaz Galeas, lead volunteer (IDLE Intro, Functional Overload, Ouroboros)
- Jonathan Bell, assistant volunteer (Word Soup, Binomial Coefficients)
- Jan Iglesias, assistant volunteer (The Barnyard)

## Important Notes

Course instructor reserved the right to assign a programming assignment from the previous academic year.
